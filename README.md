# Blood on the Clocktower Tools

Simply put, this is a collection of Blood on the Clocktower tools created by David Gray. 

When new tools are created, they will be added here. 

If I decide to add other tools, they will be credited here. 

The tools here will in general be used to help enhance the in person offline experience, namely when using experimental characters.

### Starting out and updating

When you first clone this repo, no tools are initialized and the submodules will be empty. 

To initialize everything (or updating the scripts), run the following command in the BOTC_Tools directory

`sh init_tools.sh`

## Current Tools

### Almanac Generator (by David Gray)
This takes in a script (which may be retrieved from script.bloodontheclocktower.com) and creates a formatted docx file containing a script. 

### Night Order Generator (by David Gray)
This takes in a script (which may be retrieved from script.bloodontheclocktower.com) and creates a night order chart.
