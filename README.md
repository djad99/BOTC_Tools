# Blood on the Clocktower Tools

Simply put, this is a collection of Blood on the Clocktower tools created by David Gray. 

When new tools are created, they will be added here. 

If I decide to add other tools, they will be credited here. 

The tools here will in general be used to help enhance the in person offline experience, namely when using experimental characters.
